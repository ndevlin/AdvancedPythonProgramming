Alan Turing, an English mathematician, logician, and cryptanalyst, was a computer pioneer. Often remembered for his contributions to the fields of artificial intelligence and modern computer science before either even existed, Turing is probably best known for what is now dubbed the “Turing Test.” It is a process of testing a machines ability to “think.” The basic premise of the Turing Test is that a human judge would be placed in isolation and have two conversations - one with a computer and one with another person - except the judge wouldn’t be told which was which. If the computer could fool the judge and carry on a conversation that is indistinguishable from that of the human, the computer is said to have passed the Turing Test. 
Less is known, however, about Turing’s intelligence work during WWII when he used his mathematical and cryptologic skills to help break one of the most difficult of German ciphers, ENIGMA.
ENIGMA was a cipher machine—each keystroke replaced a character in the message with another character determined by the machine’s rotor settings and wiring arrangements that were previously established between the sender and the receiver.
